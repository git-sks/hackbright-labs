Since this is interactive, let's have a fake input handler:

    >>> import sys
    >>> def fake_input(prompt):
    ...     sys.stdout.write(prompt)
    ...     v = _inputs.pop(0)
    ...     print(v)
    ...     return v

    >>> try:
    ...     import __builtin__ as b    # Python 2
    ... except ImportError:
    ...     import builtins as b       # Python 3

    >>> b.raw_input = b.input = fake_input

And randint should always return The Answer:

    >>> import random
    >>> random.randint = lambda a, b: 42

Here are our guesses:

    >>> _inputs = ["Jennifer", "50", "75", "42"]

Let's check the basic version of the game!

    >>> import game
    Howdy, what's your name?
    (type in your name) Jennifer
    Jennifer, I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
    Can you guess what the number is?
    Your guess? 50
    Your guess is too high, try again.
    Your guess? 75
    Your guess is too high, try again.
    Your guess? 42
    Well done, Jennifer!
    You found my number in 3 tries!

Here are our new guesses, since the original _inputs should be empty:

    >>> _inputs = ["Jennifer", "50", "75", "42", "y", "4.2", "1024", "apple", "42", "n"]

Now, let's try the more sophisticated guessing game:

    >>> import game_adv
    Howdy, what's your name?
    (type in your name) Jennifer
    Jennifer, I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
    Can you guess what the number is?
    Your guess? 50
    Your guess is too high, try again.
    Your guess? 75
    Your guess is too high, try again.
    Your guess? 42
    Well done, Jennifer!
    You found my number in 3 tries!
    Do you want to play again? y
    Jennifer, I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
    Can you guess what the number is?
    Your guess? 4.2
    That's not an integer, try again
    Your guess? 1024
    That's not between 1 and 100. Try again.
    Your guess? apple
    That's not an integer, try again
    Your guess? 42
    Well done, Jennifer!
    You found my number in 1 tries!
    Do you want to play again? n
    Your best score was 1.
